# Assignment 1 - DFA State Diagram using TikZ and Beamer

## Project Overview
Demonstrate how to draw a 4-state Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using LaTeX with the TikZ package on one PDF page, ideally using Beamer for presentation.  
The DFA will follow the correct notation for state diagrams used in the course textbook.  
The presentation will also demonstrate that the position of a state can be easily moved or edited by modifying the TikZ code.

## Project Status
This repository has been initialized and project setup is in progress.  
The DFA design, TikZ diagram, and Beamer presentation will be added in subsequent commits.

---

## Planned File Structure
- `dfa_diagram.tex` — TikZ code for the DFA (to be added)
- `main.tex` — Beamer presentation (to be added)
- `README.md` — project description and documentation

---

## Work Distribution (Planned)
The work will be divided between both group members, with each contributing code and commits to this repository.

- **Nicole Zino**: DFA design and TikZ diagram implementation  
- **Inder Nijjar**: Beamer presentation setup and diagram layout edits

---

## Tools
- LaTeX
- TikZ (automata library)
- Beamer

## References
References and citations will be added as the project progresses, including the course textbook and LaTeX/TikZ documentation.
